<!--
ChatGPT
GitHub Copilot
Cursor AI Editor
Same problem on different level

but there should be some way how to pass commitments to ai Agents

commitments like what range and format shout the output have, which knowledgeto uses which company values to reflect and what should be the language and tone of voice
-->

### Better Integration:

```javascript
import { countWords, countPages } from '@promptbook/utils';

const openai = new OpenAI( /* ... API Key ... */});

for (let i = 0; i < RETRY_COUNT; i++) {
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        /* ... Prompt ... */
    });
    const email = response.choices[0].message.content;

    if (/\*+/.match(name)) {
        continue;
    }

    if (countWords(email) < 10 || countPages(email) > 2) {
        continue;
    }

    return email;
}
```

# Disadvantages

-   ☹ Portability (i.e. `gpt-4` vs `claude-3.7`)
-   ☹ Need for Programmer or no-code tool
-   ☹ Mixing code and prompt
-   ☹ Security issues (i.e. prompt injection)
-   ☹ Reliability issues (fails in edge cases)

---

# Is this some better way to write
# AI Agents and AI Apps?

<!--
