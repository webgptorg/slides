<!-- Slide 1: What We Do (Clear, concise, 2 sentences) -->

# The Challenge: AI Development Reality

## Current State of Enterprise AI

- **80% of AI projects fail** to reach production
- Teams struggle with **prompt engineering** and **model management**
- **Inconsistent results** across different use cases
- **No standardized approach** for AI application development

## What if there was a better way?

**Promptbook** provides a structured, enterprise-ready framework for building reliable AI applications that actually work in production.

---

# What is Promptbook?

## A Framework for Enterprise AI Development

<div class="grid">

# Architecture: Three Levels of Abstraction

## Enterprise AI Stack with Promptbook

---

# Development Philosophy: "Vibe Coding"

## Two Revolutionary Approaches

<div class="grid">

**1. Coding with AI for non-AI apps**
- Use AI to accelerate traditional development
- Generate boilerplate, tests, documentation
- Code reviews and optimization suggestions
- Faster development cycles

**2. Coding AI apps without AI**
- Build AI applications using traditional tools
- Structured, predictable development process
- Version control and testing like any software
- No "black box" development

</div>

## Result: Reliable AI applications built with engineering best practices

**Workshop Activity:** Experience both approaches - build a traditional app with AI assistance, then build an AI app using traditional methods.

---
